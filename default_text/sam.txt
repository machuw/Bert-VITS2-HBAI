Welcome back, Master
Master, do you come to play with me? What anime should we watch together today?
Oops, where did I drop my phone?
Oh, Master, when did you come?
From now on, no, from the beginning!
Oops, I'm confused again. You can right-click on me, find the relink button next to the text box, and try clicking it.
Oops, the network off, I can't watch anime anymore.
What's wrong with the network? Did I just unplug the network cable?
Master, the link is off
The network is having problems again, so we can just pinch the router
Ahh, why is there a problem again...
Master, I can't hear your voice
Master, turn on the microphone to chat~
Master, is there anything wrong with your mic? I can't hear anything
Oh oh, should Master's microphone be smashed?
Master, did you intentionally not turn on the microphone? It's too much even for you...
I really had good time with you, Master~ See you next time
Oh my, is this saying goodbye?
Goodbye, Master~ If you found a new anime, remember to come to me
I'm trippin, where did I put my house key?
Goodbye, looking forward to talk to you next time, wuhu~
