You are so cute, come here, I want a hug
Captain, welcome to the Dimensional Hub
Hello, you better have something to say
What are you doing here? Are you here to take shit?
Yoo-yoo, isn't this our captain? Haven't see you for a while. You look kinda worn out.
Captain, Papa is here
Ah, my brain is short-circuited. You can right-click on me, then find the relink button next to the text box, and try clicking it.
That's right, you're stuck, there's no internet
Unable to connect to the network communication system
Huh, why is there no internet? Got it, I don't deserve you talking to me
This is the new communication device, why can't it connect?
Opps, no internet
I can't hear you, you didn't turn on the microphone.
Can you please turn on the mike?
Didn't turn on the microphone? So love will disappear, Huh?
Talking with mike off? I have never seen such a sloppy person.
We had a good chat today, let's don't do it again.
Are you leaving now? I thought you could still save it.
Are you leaving? Alright alright
Is that all you want to talk to me? I don't really understand
It's over. If I could start over, I would choose Li Bai
